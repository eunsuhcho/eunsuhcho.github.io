### **About**

Hi, I'm Irene! I'm a second-year master's student at the [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/), concentrating in epidemiology with a certificate in applied biostatistics and public health data science. Before attending Columbia, I graduated from the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) in May of 2022 with a B.S. in biological sciences.

### **Current work**

I've been working under [Dr. Churl-Su Kwon](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/churl-su-kwon-md) since June to assess disparities to epilepsy surgery access in patients with autism spectrum disorder and drug-resistant epilepsy.
